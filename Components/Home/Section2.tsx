        <H5 m={1}>Hey,  it's me Sandra... How y'all doing?
          I'll start from a bit about myself, those who don't know me. I was born
          and brought up in Kozhikode...the place where my heart is. I had a very happy
          and fulfilling childhood growing up, I was always surrounded by love and support
          from my parents. They encouraged me to pursue my passions and try new things,
          whether it was playing sports, taking dance lessons, or joining the school band,
          or may it be anything that I like.
        </H5>

        <H5 m={1}>I was a fine student in school, and I enjoyed learning new things and challenging myself academically.
          During my school days,
          I had a great group of friends who I loved to spend time with, whether
          it was hanging out, going on rides, or having sleepovers. I know you people are missing me a lot.
          I too miss those days where I was much happier!
          Childhood is the most pleasing of all lifeâ€™s seasons. So was mine. My childhood memories are
          very special and I would like to treasure them. Those days were the best.</H5>
